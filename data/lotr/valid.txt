said. That's what started all the mischief. And while you're been trapessing
in foreign parts, chasing  Black Men  up  mountains from  what my  Sam says,
though what for he don't make clear, they've been and dug up Bagshot Row and
ruined my taters!'
'I  am very  sorry, Mr.  Gamgee,' said Frodo. 'But now I've  come back,
I'll do my best to make amends.'
'Well,  you  can't say  fairer than that,' said  the gaffer. 'Mr. Frodo
Baggins  is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever  you may think
of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam's
behaved
hisself and given satisfaction?'
'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,'  said Frodo. 'Indeed,  if you  will
believe it, he's  now one of the most famous  people  in all  the lands, and
they are making songs about his deeds from  here to  the Sea and beyond  the
Great River.' Sam blushed,  but he looked gratefully at Frodo,  for  Rosie's
eyes were shining and she was smiling at him.
'It takes a lot o' believing,' said  the gaffer, 'though I can see he's
been mixing in strange company. What's come of his weskit? I don't hold with
wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.'
Farmer  Cotton's household  and  all  his  guests  were  up  early next
morning. Nothing  had  been  heard  in  the  night, but more  trouble  would
certainly  come before the  day was old.  'Seems as if none o' the  ruffians

####-were left  up at Bag End,' said Cotton; 'but  the gang from Waymeet will  be
along any time now.'
After breakfast  a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in  high
spirits. 'The Thain has raised  all our country,' he said, 'and the news  is
going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled
off south, those that escaped alive. The  Thain has gone after them, to hold
off the big gang down  that way; but he's sent Mr Peregrin back with all the
other folk he can spare.'
The next news  was less good. Merry, who had been out  all  night, came
riding in about ten  o'clock. 'There's a big band about four miles away,' he
said.  'They're  coming along the  road from Waymeet, but a good many  stray
ruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them;
and they're fire-raising as they come. Curse them!'
'Ah! This  lot  won't stay to  talk, they'll kill, if they  can,'  said
Farmer  Cotton.  'If Tooks don't come sooner, we'd best get behind cover and
shoot without  arguing.  There's  got to  be  some  fighting  before this is
settled, Mr. Frodo.'
The  Tooks  did come sooner.  Before long  they  marched in, a  hundred
strong,  from  Tuckborough and  the Green Hills with  Pippin at their  head.
Merry now  had  enough  sturdy  hobbitry to deal with  the  ruffians. Scouts
reported  that  they  were  keeping  close  together.  They  knew  that  the
countryside had risen against  them,  and  plainly  meant  to  deal with the
rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might
be, they  seemed to have  no leader among  them who understood warfare.
They
came on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly.
The ruffians  came tramping along  the  East Road, and  without halting
turned up the Bywater Road,  which ran for  some way sloping up between
high
banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend,  about a  furlong from  the main
road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them.
At the same  moment they  became aware that  the hedges on  both sides,  just
above their  heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them  other  hobbits
now pushed out  some more waggons  that had  been  hidden in a field, and so
blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above.
'Well, you  have walked into a trap, '  said Merry. 'Your  fellows  from
Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the  rest are prisoners. Lay down

####-your weapons! Then  go  back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to
break
out will be shot.'
But  the ruffians could  not now  be  cowed  so easily.  A few of  them
obeyed, but were immediately set on  by their fellows. A score or more broke
back  and  charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the  remainder burst out,
killing two hobbits, and then  scattering across country in the direction of
the  Woody End. Two more fell as they ran.  Merry blew a loud horn-call, and
there were answering calls from a distance.
'They won't get far,' said  Pippin. 'All that country is alive with our
hunters now.'
Behind,  the trapped Men in the lane,  still about four score, tried to
climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged  to shoot many
of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and  most desperate
got out on the west side, and  attacked  their enemies  fiercely ,  being now
more  bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were
wavering, when Merry and Pippin,  who were on the east side, came across and
charged  the ruffians. Merry himself slew  the  leader, a  great squint -eyed
brute like  a huge orc.  Then he drew  his forces off,  encircling the  last
remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers.
At last all  was over.  Nearly  seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the
field, and a dozen  were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits  were killed, a nd  some
thirty were wounded. The dead  ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
to an  old sand-pit nearby and there buried:  in the Battle  Pit, as it  was
afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were  laid together in a grave on  the
hill-side,  wher e later a great  stone was set up with a garden about it. So
ended the  Battle of Bywater, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and
the  only battle since the  Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing.
In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a  chapter  to
itself in the Red Book, and  the names of all those  who took part were made
into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable
rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the
top of the Roll  in all  accounts  stand the names of  Captains Meriadoc and
Peregrin.
Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief
part had  been to prevent the hobbits  in their wrath at  their losses, from
slaying those  of  their enemies who  threw  down  their  weapons. When  the

####-fighting  was over,  and  the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and
Sam joined him, and  they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday
meal, and then Frodo said with a  sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that
we dealt with the "Chief".'
'Yes indeed; the  sooner the better,'  said  Merry.  'And don't be  too
gentle! He's  responsible  for bringing  in these ruffians, and  for all the
evil they have done.'
Farmer Cotton  collected an escort  of some two  dozen  sturdy hobbits.
'For it's only a guess that  there is no ruffians left at Bag End,' he said.
'We don't know.' Then  they set out  on foot. Frodo, Sam,  Merry, and Pippin
led the way.
It was one of the saddest hours  in their lives. The great chimney rose
up  before them;  and as  they drew  near the old  village across the Water,
through rows of new  mean houses along each side of the  road, they saw  the
new mill in all its  frowning and  dirty ugliness:  a  great  brick building
straddling  the  stream, which  it  fouled  with  a  steaming  and  stinking
overflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled.
As  they crossed the bridge  and looked up the Hill  they  gasped. Even
Sam's vision in the Mirror  had not prepared  him for what they saw. The Old
Grange  on the  west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows
of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone. The  banks and  hedgerows were
broken. Great  waggons wer e standing in  disorder in  a field beaten bare of
grass. Bagshot  Row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. Bag End up.
beyond
could not be seen for a clutter of large huts.
'They've cut it down!' cried Sam. 'They've cut down the Party Tree!' He
pointed to where the tree. had stood under which Bilbo had made his Farewell
Speech. It was lying lopped and  dead in the field. As if this was the  last
straw Sam burst into tears.
A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over  the
low wall of the  mill-yard. He was grimy -faced and  black -handed.  'Don't  'ee
like it, Sam?'  he sneered. 'But  you always  was soft. I thought you'd gone
off in  one o' them ships  you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What
d'you want to come back for? We've work to do in the Shire now.'
'So I see,' said Sam. 'No time for washing, but time for wall-propping.
But  see here,  Master  Sandyman,  I've a score to pay in this village,  and
don't you make it any longer with your  jeering, or you'll  foot a bill  too

####-big for your purse.'
Ted Sandyman spat over the wall: 'Garn!' he said. 'You can't touch  me.
I'm  a friend o'  the  Boss's. But he'll touch you all right, if I have  any
more of your mouth.'
'Don't  waste any more words  on  the  fool, Sam!' said Frodo. 'I  hope
there are not many more hobbits that have become like  this.  It  would be a
worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.'
'You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,' said Merry. 'And also very much
out of your reckoning. We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious
Boss. We have dealt with his Men.'
Ted gaped, for at  that moment he first caught sight of the escort that
at a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing back into the mill
he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly.
'Save your breath!' laughed Merry. 'I've a better.' Then lifting up his
silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang  over the Hill; and out of
the  holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and
came pouring out, and  with cheers and loud cries they followed  the company
up the road to Bag End.
At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went
on; and they came at  last to the once beloved place. The garden wa s full of
huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that  they cut off all
their  light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door  was  scarred;
the bell-chain  was dangling  loose, and the bell would not  ring.  Knocking
brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in.
The  place stank  and was  full of filth and  disorder: it did not appear to
have been used for some time.
'Where  is that miserable Lotho hiding?' said Merry. They  had searched
every room  and found no living thing save rats and  mice. 'Shall we turn on
the others to search the sheds?'
'This is  worse than Mordor!' said Sam. 'Much worse in  a way. It comes
home to you, as  they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it
was all ruined.'
'Yes,  this is Mordor,' said Frodo. 'Just one of its works. Saruman was
doing  its  work all  the time,  even  when he  thought  he was working  for
himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.'
Merry looked round in dismay and disgust. 'Let's get out!' he said. 'If
I had known all the  mischief he had caused, I should  have stuffed my pouch

####-down Saruman's throat.'
'No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I  am  able to welcome you
home.' There standing at the  door was Saruman himself, looking well -fed and
well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement.
A sudden light broke on Frodo. 'Sharkey!' he cried.
Saruman laughed.  'So you have heard the name, have you? All  my people
used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly.(
But evidently you did not expect to see me here.'
'I did not,' said Frodo. 'But I might  have guessed.  A little mischief
in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it.
'Quite  capable,'  said Saruman, 'and more  than a little. You  made me
laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding  along with  all  those  great people so
secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very
well out of it a ll, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time
in the country. Saruman's home could  be all wrecked, and he could be turned
out, but no one could touch  yours. Oh  no!  Gandalf would look  after  your
affairs.'
Saruman laughed  again. 'Not he! When his tools have done their task he
drops them. But you must  go dangling  after him,  dawdling and talking, and
riding round twice as far as you needed. "Well," thought I, "if they're such
fools, I  will  get ahead of them and  teach  them  a  lesson.  One ill turn
deserves another." It  would  have been  a  sharper lesson, if  only you had
given  me a  little  more time and more Men. Still  I have already done much
that you will  find  it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And  it  will be
plea sant to think of that and set it against my injuries.'
'Well, if that is what you find  pleasure in,' said Frodo, 'I pity you.
It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!'
The hobbits of the villages  had  seen Saruman  come out of one  of the
huts, and at once they came crowding up  to  the door of  Bag End. When they
heard Frodo's command, they murmured angrily:
'Don't let him go! Kill him! He's a villain and a murderer. Kill him!'
Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. 'Kill  him!' he
mocked. 'Kill him, if you think there  are enough of you, my brave hobbits!'
He drew himself  up and stared at them darkly  with his black eyes.  'But do
not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes
me shall  be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and
never again be healed.'

####-     The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: 'Do  not believe him! He has lost
all power, save his voice that  can still daunt you and deceive you, if  you
let it.  But  I will not  have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with
revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!'
'Worm! Worm!' Saruman called; and out of a  nearby hut came
Wormtongue,
crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!' said Saruman.  'These
fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!'
Saruman turned  to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after  him.  But even as
Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his  hand,  and  he stabbed
swiftly.  The blade turned  on  the hidden  mail-coat  and snapped.  A dozen
hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung  the villain to the
ground. Sam drew his sword.
'No, Sam!' said  Frodo. 'Do not kill him even now.  For he has not hurt
me.  And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was
great once, of  a  noble kind that we  should  not  dare to raise  our hands
against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us;  but  I would still  spare
him, in the hope that he may find it.'
Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look
in his  eyes of mingled wonder and  respect and  hatred.  'You  have  grown,
Halfling,' he said. 'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel.
You  have  robbed  my revenge of  sweetness,  and  now  I must go  hence  in
bitterness, in debt to your mercy.  I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will
trouble you no more. But do  not expect me to wish you health and long life.
You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.'
He walked away, and  the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their
knuckles whitened as  they gripped  on their  weapons. Wormtongue hesitated,
and then followed his master.
'Wormtongue!' called Frodo. 'You need not follow him. I know of no evil
you have done to me. You can  have rest and food here for a while, until you
are stronger and can go your own ways.'
Wormtongue  halted  and  looked  back at  him, half  prepared  to  stay.
Saruman turned.  'No evil?'  he  cackled. 'Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at
night it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone ask where poor
Lotho is hiding? You know, don't you, Worm? Will you tell them?'
Wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: 'No, no!'
'Then I  will,'  said Saruman.  'Worm killed  your  Chief,  poor little

####-fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn't you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I
believe.  Buried him, I hope;  though Worm has been very hungry lately.  No,
Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.'
A look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue's red eyes. 'You told me to;
you made me do it,' he hissed.
Saruman laughed. 'You do what Sharkey says,  always, don't  you,  Worm?
Well,  now  he  says:  follow!'  He  kicked  Wormtongue in  the face  as  he
grovelled, and  turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly
Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog
he sprang on Saruman's back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and  with
a yell  ran off  down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or  speak a word,
three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead.
To the dismay of those that stood by, about the  body of Saruman a grey
mist gathered, and  rising slowly to a great height like smoke  from a fire,
as a pale shrouded  figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered,
looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away,
and with a sigh dissolved into nothing.
Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it
seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank,
and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up
the skirt  of the dirty cloak  that sprawled beside  it, he covered it over,
and turned away.
'And  that's  the end of that,'  said Sam. 'A nasty end,  and I  wish I
needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.'
'And the very last end of the War, I hope,' said Merry.
'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed. 'The very last stroke. But to think
that it  should fall here, at the very  door  of Bag End! Among all my hopes
and fears at least I never expected that.'
'I shan't call it  the end, till we've cleared  up  the mess,' said Sam
gloomily. 'And that'll take a lot of time and work.'


####-

Chapter 9. The Grey Havens



The clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but  it took  less time
than Sam had feared. The day  after the battle Frodo  rode to Michel Delving
and released the prisoners from  the Lockholes. One  of the first  that they
found was  poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the
ruffians smoked  out a band of rebels that  he  led from their hidings up in
the Brockenbores by the hills of Scary.
'You  would have  done better  to  come with us  after  all,  poor  old
Fredegar!' said Pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk.
He opened an eye and tried gallantly to  smile. 'Who's this young giant
with the loud voice?' he  whispered. 'Not little Pippin! What's your size in
hats now?'
Then  there  was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when
they rescued her  from a dark and narrow  cell. She insisted on hobbling out
on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and
cheering when she appeared,  leaning on Frodo's arm but still clutching  her
umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never
in her life been popular before. But she was crushed  by the news of  Lotho's
murder, and she would' not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and
went to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle.
When the poor  creature died next Spring-she  was after all more than a
hundred years  old  - Frodo was  surprised and much  moved: she had left all
that remained of her money and of Lotho's for him to use in helping  hobbits
made homeless by the troubles. So that feud was ended.
Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though
he had  perhaps  been treated  less harshly  than  some,  he needed a lot of
feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as
his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was  in shape again. The  only  thing that he
did as  Deputy Mayor was  to reduce the Shirriffs to  their proper functions
and numbers. The task of  hunting  out the last remnant of  the ruffians was
left to Merry and  Pippin,  and  it was soon done. The southern gangs, after
hearing the news of the Battle of  Bywater, fled out of the land and offered
little resistance to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were
rounded  up in  the  woods,  and those  that  surrendered were shown  to the

####-borders.
Meanwhile the  labour  of  repair went on apace, and   Sam was kept very
busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood  and the need comes on
them.
Now  there were thousands of willing  hands of all ages, from the  small but
nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of
the gaffers  and gammers.  Before Yule not a brick was left standing of  the
new Shirriff-houses  or of anything that had been built by 'Sharkey's  Men';
but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger  and
drier. Great stores of goods a nd  food, and beer,  were found that had  been
hidden away  by  the  ruffians in  sheds and barns and deserted  holes,  and
especially in the tunnels  at Michel  Delving  and  in the  old quarries  at
Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had
hoped for.
One of the first  things done in Hobbiton,  before even  the removal of
the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the  restoration
of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into
a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back
into the Hill, and they  were lined with brick. The Gaffer  was  restored to
Number Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it:
'It's an  ill wind as  blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All's
well as ends Better!'
There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given.
Battle  Gardens  was thought  of,  or Better  Smials.  But  after a while in
sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely  Bywater
joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End.
The trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey's bidding they
had been  cut down recklessly far  and wide over the Shire; and Sam  grieved
over this more than anything else. For  one thing, this hurt would take long
to heal, and only  his great-grandchildren, he thought,  would see the Shire
as it ought to be.
Then  suddenly  one day, for he had  been too busy for  weeks to give a
thought to  his adventures,   he remembered the gift of Galadriel. He brought
the box  out and showed it to  the  other Travellers (for  so they were  now
called by everyone), and asked their advice.
'I wondered when you would think of it,' said Frodo. 'Open it!'
Inside it was filled with a grey  dust, soft and fine, in the middle of

####-which was a seed, like a small nut with a  silver shale. 'What can I do with
this?' said Sam.
'Throw it in the air on  a breezy day  and  let it do  its  work!' said
Pippin.
'On what?' said Sam.
'Choose one spot  as  a  nursery, and  see what happens  to the  plants
there,' said Merry.
'But I'm  sure  the Lady  would not like me to keep it all  for my  own
garden, now so many folk have suffered,' said Sam.
'Use all the wi ts and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,' said Frodo,
'and then  use the  gift to  help  your  work  and  better  it. And  use  it
sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.'
So Sam planted saplings in all the  places where specially beautiful or
beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in
the soil at the root of each. He went up and  down the Shire in this labour;
but if he  paid special attention to Hobbiton and Bywater no one blamed h im.
And  at  the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he
went to the Three-Farthing  Stone, which is as near the centre of the  Shire
as no matter, and cast it  in  the air with his  blessing. The little silver
nut he  planted  in the Party Field where the tree had  once  been;  and  he
wondered  what would  come  of  it. All through  the winter  he remained  as
patient  as  he  could,  and tried  to  restrain himself  from  going  round
constantly to see if anything was happening.
Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow,
as if time was in a hurry and  wished to make one year do for twenty. In the
Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long
leaves and burst into golden flowers  in April. It was indeed a mallorn, and
it was the wonder of the neighbourhood.  In after years, as it grew in grace
and beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys
to
see it: the only mallorn  west of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one
of the finest in the world.
Altogether 1420 in  the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was there
wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but
there seemed something more: an air of richness and growth, and a gleam of a
beauty  beyond  that  of  mortal summers  that flicker  and  pass  upon this
Middle-earth. All the children born or begotten in that year, and there were

####-many, were fair to see and strong, and most of them  had a rich golden  hair
that had before  been rare  among hobbits.  The fruit was so  plentiful that
young  hobbits very nearly bathed in  strawberries and cream; and later they
sat on the lawns under the plum-trees  and ate, until they had made piles of
stones  like  small pyramids or  the  heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then
they  moved on. And no  one was ill,  and everyone was pleased. except those
who had to mow the grass.
In the  Southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of 'leaf' was
astonishing; and everywhere there was  so much  corn that at  Harvest  every
barn was stuffed. 'The  Northfarthing barley  was so fine  that the beer  of
1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed a generation
later
one might hear an  old gaffer  in an inn, aft er  a good pint  of well-earned
ale,  put  down his mug with a sigh:  'Ah! that was  proper fourteen-twenty,
that was!'
Sam stayed at first at  the Cottons'  with Frodo; but when  the New Row
was ready he went  with the Gaffer. In addition to all his  other  labours he
was  busy  directing  the cleaning up and restoring  of Bag End; but he  was
often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early
March and did not know that  Frodo had  been ill. On the  thirteenth of that
month  Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching  a white
gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream.
'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.'
But the fit  passed, and  when Sam got back on  the twenty-fifth, Frodo
had  recovered, and he said nothing about  himself. In the meanwhile Bag End
had  been  set  in order,  and Merry and Pippin came over  from  Crickhollow
bringing back  all the old furniture  and gear, so that  the  old hole  soon
looked very much as it always had done.
When all was at last ready Frodo said: 'When are you  going to  move in
and join me, Sam?'
Sam looked a bit awkward.
'There is no need to come yet, if you don't want to,'  said Frodo. 'But
you k now the Gaffer  is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after
by Widow Rumble.'
It s not that, Mr. Frodo, said Sam, and he went ver red.
'Well, what is it?'
'It's Rosie, Rose Cotton,' said Sam. 'It seems she didn't like my going

####-abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn't spoken, she couldn't say so. And I
didn't speak, because I had  a job to  do first. But now I have  spoken, and
she says:  "Well, you've  wasted  a year,  so why wait longer?"  "Wasted?" I
says. "I wouldn't call it that." Still I see what she means. I feel torn  in
two, as you might say.'
'I see,' said Frodo: 'you want to get married, and yet you want to live
with me in  Bag End too? But my dear  Sam, how easy! Get  married as soon as
you  can, and then move in with Rosie. There's room enough in Bag End for as
big a family as you could wish for.'
And so it was settled. Sam Gamgee married Rose Cotton in the Spring  of
1420 (which was  also famous  for its weddings), and they came and lived  at
Bag End. And if Sam thought himself lucky, Frodo knew that he was more
lucky
himself; for there was not a hobbit in the  Shire that was looked after with
such care. When the labours of repair  had all been planned and set going he
took to a quiet life, writing a great dea l and  going through all his notes.
He resigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that mid-summer, and
dear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at Banquets.
Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow, and  there
was  much coming  and  going between  Buckland and Bag  End.  The two
young
Travellers cut a great  dash in the Shire  with  their songs and their tales
and their finery,  and  their wonderful  parties. 'Lordly' folk called them,
meaning nothing bu t good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go  riding by
with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and
singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent,  they
were unchanged otherwise, unless they were  indeed  more fairspoken and
more
jovial and full of merriment than ever before.
Frodo and Sam, however, went back to ordinary attire,  except that when
there was need they both wore long grey cloaks,  finely woven and clasped at
the throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr. Frodo wore always a  white jewel
on a chain that he often would finger.
All things now went well, with  hope always of becoming  still  better;
and Sam  was  as busy and as  full of delight as even a hobbit  could  wish.
Nothing  for him marred that whole year, except  for some vague anxiety about
his  master. Frodo dropped quietly  out of all the doings of the  Shire, and

####-Sam was  pained to notice how little  honour he  had in his own country. Few
people  knew  or  wanted  to  know about  his  deeds and  adventures;  their
admiration  and  respect were given mostly  to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin
and (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in  the  autumn there appeared  a
shadow of old troubles.
One evening Sam came into the  study and  found his master looking very
strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away.
'What's the matter, Mr. Frodo?' said Sam.
'I am wounded,' he answered, 'wounded; it will never really heal.'
But then  he  got   up, and the  turn seemed to  pass, and he  was quite
himself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled that the
date  was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it was dark in the
dell under Weathertop.
Time went on, and 1421 came  in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with
a great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The
first of  Sam and Rosie's children was born on the twenty-fifth of  March, a
date that Sam noted.
'Well,  Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'I'm in a bit of  a fix.  Rose  and me had
settled  to  call him Frodo, with  your leave; but it's  not  him , it's her.
Though as pretty a maidchild  as any one  could hope for, taking after  Rose
more than me, luckily. So we don't know what to do.'
'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo,  'what's wrong with the old customs? Choose a
flower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire are called by such
names, and what could be better?'
'I  suppose  you're  right,  Mr.  Frodo,'  said  Sam.  'I've heard some
beautiful names on my travels,  but  I  suppose they're  a bit too grand for
daily wear and tear, as you  might say. The Gaffer, he says: "Make it short,
and  then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it." But if it's
to be a  flower-name, then I don't  trouble about  the length: it  must be a
beautiful  flower, because, you see, I  think  she is very beautiful, and is
going to be beautifuller still.'
Frodo  thought  for  a  moment.  'Well,  Sam,  what  about  elanor, the
sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlurien?'
'You're  right  again, Mr. Frodo!' said  Sam delighted.  'That's what I
wanted.'
Little  Elanor  was nearly six months  old, and 1421  had passed to its
autumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study.

####-     'It will be Bilbo's Birthday on Thursday, Sam,'  he  said. 'And he will
pass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!'
'So he will!' said Sam. 'He's a marvel!'
'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo. 'I want you to see Rose  and  find out if she
can spare  you, so that you and I can go off together.  You can't go  far or
for a long time now, of course,' he said a little wistfully.
'Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.'
'Of course not.  But never mind.  You can see me on my way.  Tell  Rose
that you won't be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you'll come
back quite safe.'
'I wish I could go all  the way  with  you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo, and
see Mr. Bilbo,' said Sam. 'And yet the only place I really want to  be in is
here. I am that torn in two.'
'Poor Sam! It will feel like that, I am  afraid,'  said Frodo. 'But you
will be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.'
In the next day or  two Frodo went through his papers and  his writings
with Sam, and he handed over his keys.  There was  a big book with plain red
leather  covers; its  tall  pages were  now almost filled.  At the beginning
there were many leaves covered with Bilbo's thin wandering hand; but most of
it was written in Frodo's firm flowing script.  It was divided into chapters
but  Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that  were some  blank leaves. The
title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so:

My  Diary. My Unexpected  Journey.  There  and  Back  Again.  And  What
Happened After.
Adventures of  Five  Hobbits. The Tale  of the Great  Ring, compiled by
Bilbo  Baggins from his own  observations  and the  accounts of his friends.
What we did in the War of the Ring.
Here Bilbo's hand ended and Frodo had written:

THE DOWNFALL
OF THE
LORD OF THE RINGS
AND THE
RETURN OF THE KING

(as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs  of Bilbo and Frodo of

####-the Shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of
the Wise.)
Together  with  extracts from  Books of  Lore  translated by  Bilbo  in
Rivendell.
'Why, you  have  nearly finished  it, Mr. Frodo!' Sam exclaimed. 'Well,
you have kept at it, I must say.'
'I have quite finished, Sam,' said Frodo. 'The last pages are for you.'
On September the twenty-first  they set out together, Frodo on the pony
that  had  borne him  all the  way  from  Minas  Tirith, and was  now called
Strider; and Sam on his beloved Bill. It  was a fair golden morning, and Sam
did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess.
They took the Stock Road over the hills and went towards the Woody End,
and they let their ponies walk  at their leisure.  They camped  in the Green
Hills,  and  on September the twenty-second  they rode gently down  into the
beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away.
'If that isn't the very tree you hid  behind when the Black Rider first
showed up, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam pointing to the left. 'It seems like a dream
now.'
It  was  evening, and the stars were glimmering  in the  eastern sky as
they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on  down the hill between the
hazel-thickets. Sam  was  silent,  deep in his memories. Presently he became
aware   that  Frodo  was  singing  softly  to  himself,   singing   the  old
walking-song, but the words were not quite the same.
Still round the corner there may wait
A new road or a secret gate;
And though I oft have passed them by,
A day will come at last when I
Shall take the hidden paths that run
West of the Moon, East of the Sun.
And  as if in answer,  from down below,  coming up the road out of  the
valley, voices sang:
A! Elbereth Gilthoniel!
silivren penna mnriel
o menel aglar elenath,
Gilthoniel, A! Elbereth!
We still remember, we who dwell
In this far land beneath the trees

####-     The starlight on the Western Seas.
Frodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw
a shimmer as the travellers came towards them.
There was Gildor  and  many fair Elven folk; and there  to Sam's wonder
rode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a  mantle of grey and had a star upon
his forehead, and  a silver harp was in his  hand, and upon his finger was a
ring of gold with a  great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of  the  Three.  But
Galadriel sat upon a white palfrey  and  was robed all in glimmering  white,
like  clouds  about the Moon; for  she herself seemed  to shine with a  soft
light.  On  her  finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril ,  that bore a
single white stone  flickering like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a
small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was Bilbo himself.
Elrond greeted  them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel  smiled upon
them. 'Well, Master Samwise,'  she said.  'I hear and see that you have used
my  gift well. The Shire shall now be  more than ever blessed  and beloved.'
Sam bowed, but found nothing to say. He had forgotten how beautiful the Lady
was.
Then Bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. 'Hullo, Frodo!' he said. 'Well,
I have passed the  Old Took today! So that's  settled. And now I think I  am
quite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?'
'Yes, I am coming,' said Frodo. 'The Ring-bearers should go together.'
'Where are you going, Master?' cried Sam, though at last he  understood
what was happening.
'To the Havens, Sam,' said Frodo.
'And I can't come.'
'No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not  further  than the Havens. Though you too
were a Ring-bearer, if only  for a little while. Your  time may come. Do not
be too  sad, Sam. You cannot be always torn in two. You will  have to be one
and whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.'
'But,' said  Sam, and tears started  in his eyes, 'I  thought  you were
going  to  enjoy the  Shire, too.  for years and  years, after all you  have
done.'
'So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I  tried
to  save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not  for me. It must often be
so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them,
so that others may keep them. But you are my  heir: all that I had and might
have had I leave to you.  And also you  have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo -lad

####-will  come,  and  Rosie-lass,  and Merry, and  Goldilocks,  and Pippin;  and
perhaps more  that I  cannot see. Your  hands and  your wits will  be needed
everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long a s you want to be, and
the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red
Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone. so that people will
remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the  more.  And
that will  keep  you as busy and as  happy as anyone can be, as long as your
part of the Story goes on.
'Come now, ride with me!'
Then Elrond and  Galadriel rode on; for the Third Age was over, and the
Days of the Rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and  song of
those  times. With them  went many  Elves of the High Kindred  who  would
no
longer stay in  Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was
yet  blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the
Elves delighted to honour them.
Though they rode through the midst of the Shire all the evening and all
the night, none saw them  pass,  save the wild creatures; or here  and there
some wanderer in the dark who saw a swift  shimmer  under  the trees,  or  a
light and shadow flowing  through the grass as the Moon  went westward.  And
when  they had passed from the  Shire,  going about the  south skirts of the
White Downs, they came to the Far Downs,  and to the Towers,  and  looked on
the  distant Sea; and  so they  rode down at  last to Mithlond,  to the Grey
Havens in the long firth of Lune.
As  they  came  to the gates Cnrdan the Shipwright came  forth to greet
them. Very tall he was,  and his beard  was long, and he  was grey  and old,
save that  his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and
said: 'All is now ready.'
Then Cnrdan led  them to the Havens, and there  was a white ship lying,
and upon the  quay  beside a  great  grey horse stood a  figure robed all in
white awaiting them.  As  he turned and came  towards  them  Frodo saw  that
Gandalf now wore openly  upon his  hand the Third Ring, Narya the Great, and
the stone upon it was red as fire.  Then those who were to go were glad, for
they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them.
But Sam  was now sorrowful at  heart,  and it seemed to him that if the
parting would be bitter,  more grievous  still would  be  the long road home
alone. But  even as they stood there, and the Elves were  going aboard,  and

####-all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste.
And amid his tears Pippin laughed.
'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.' he said.
'This time you have nearly  succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not
Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!'
'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together
'than one alone. Well, here at  last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea
comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth.  Go in peace!  I  will  not
say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.'
Then Frodo  kissed Merry  and Pippin,  and last  of all  Sam,  and went
aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and  the wind blew, and slowly the ship
slipped away  down  the  long  grey firth;  and the  light of  the  glass of
Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into
the  High Sea and passed on into the West, until at  last on a night of rain
Frodo smelled  a sweet  fragrance on the air  and heard the sound of singing
that came over the water. And  then it seemed to him that as in his dream in
the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver  glass and
was  rolled back, and he beheld white  shores and beyond  them  a far  green
country under a swift sunrise.
But to Sam  the evening deepened to darkness as he  stood at the Haven;
and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was
soon lost in the West. There still he stood  far into the night, hearing only
the  sigh and murmur of  the  waves on  the shores  of Middle-earth, and the
sound of them sank deep into his  heart.  Beside him stood Merry and Pippin,
and they were silent.
At last the three companions  turned away, and never again looking back
they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they
came  back to the  Shire. but each had great comfort  in his friends  on the
long grey road.
At last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and then Merry
and Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they  were singing again as they
went. But Sam turned to Bywater,  and so came back up  the Hill,  as day was
ending  once  more. And  he  went on, and there  was  yellow light, and fire
within; and the evening meal was ready, and he  was expected.  And Rose drew
him in, and set him in his chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap.
He drew a deep breath. 'Well, I'm back,' he said.
