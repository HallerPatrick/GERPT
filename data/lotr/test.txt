'Take Sandyman's mill now. Pimple  knocked it down almost as soon as he
came to Bag End. Then he  brought in a lot o' dirty-looking Men  to  build a
bigger one and fill it full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that
fool Ted was pleased by  that, and he works  there  cleaning  wheels for the
Men, where his dad was the  Miller and his own master.  Pimple's idea was to
grind  more  and faster, or  so he said. He's got other mills  like  it. But
you've got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the
new mill to do than for the  old. But since Sharkey came they don't grind no
more corn at all. They're always a -hammering and a -letting out a smoke and a
stench, and there isn't no peace even at night  in  Hobbiton.  And they pour
out filth a  purpose; they've  fouled all  the lower Water  and it's getting

' "What for?" says she.
' "To put up some sheds for Sharkey," says they.
' "Who said you could?" says she.
' "Sharkey," says they. "So get out o' the road, old hagling!"
'  "I'll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!" says  she, and
ups with  her umbrella and goes for the leader. near twice her size. So they
took  her. Dragged her off  to the Lockholes, at her age  too.  They've took
others we miss more, but  there's no  denying she  showed  more  spirit than
most.'
Into the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer. Old
Gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer.
'Good evening. Mr. Baggins!' he said. 'Glad indeed I am to see you safe
back. But  I've  a bone to pick with you, in a manner  o' speaking, if I may
make so bold. You didn't never ought  to  have a' sold Bag End, as  I always
